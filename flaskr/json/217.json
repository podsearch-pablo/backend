And Samir already found a really good song. So once you find a good song, yeah, like 90% of the video is done. Yeah, and you have a drone and you might as well put them together. So this is something we need to do. So this is something we didn't mention yesterday. The DJI Phantom 4. This is our drone and it's pretty awesome. But I still don't know how to fly it.
