{"text": " Welcome to one of these videos. People make these videos all the time because it's truly amazing how much money you can actually make on YouTube. And there's so much curiosity because no two creators are really the same. Now we're making this video because we're coming off one of our biggest months ever on YouTube in terms of how much the platform paid us. For 1.4 million views in the past month, we've made $5,280.94. Now that's almost $1,000 more than we made from YouTube in the entire year of 2019. So that's a lot of growth for us in the past month. So in this video, we're going to try and explain why we think we've seen that much growth. What is so different now as opposed to a year ago or even three months ago? Now it's important to note that this growth that we're experiencing is not just on the platform of YouTube, but in our business as a whole. And with all the creators that we talk to, it seems like this shift is happening across the entire creator world. Or the creator economy. Buzzword of 2021. So if you hang out on Twitter as much as we do, you've probably heard the term creator economy. So in this episode, we want to dig into that term. We want to define it and explain why it's had such a big rise in the past year. We're also going to talk about what all of this means for the future of creators and the creator economy. So in this episode, we're going to be speaking with Lee Jin, who's an investor and creator that's raised over $13 million to invest just in creator economy companies. We're also going to be speaking with Josh Cohen, who is the founder of TubeFilter and the Streamy Awards. He's someone who's been covering the creator economy since far before it was called the creator economy. And at the end of this video, we will tell you how much money YouTube paid us for 14 million views, which is the total amount of views that our channel has done since we started it. And during the episode, if you want to guess how much money that is, you can put that in the comments. But just don't, don't sneak your way to the end and hear it first. Like actually, on our code, make a guess. And don't look at other people's guesses because they may have cheated and gone to the end. You know, just kind of like blindfold yourself and yeah, you know, don't cheat. Nobody likes a cheater. Before we get into this episode, we want to ask you guys if you could like the video. If you've been enjoying the content, then it would also mean a lot to us. If you could subscribe. If you're into the creator economy and talking about the world of creators, it's definitely thing you'll like the show that we put out every Monday. And if you're new here, then you're about to see our show intro for the first time, which is always an exciting part of the show. It's thrilling. It really is. Yeah. And then anticipation before we roll the intro, you can just feel the tension rising right now. Come on. Give the people what they want. It is. Roll the intro. One sec. It's really a great intro. You know what's amazing is that when we first started uploading to YouTube, like I remember trying to explain the business model to my friends and family. And it was just like, okay, I think what I do is I make videos. I upload them to the site. And then the site is going to pay me, which was YouTube. Quickly, I realized that was not going to be our path, especially because the first check we got from YouTube was around 35 cents. And it was after like two months of work. So you saw that check and you're like, I need to diversify my business. Big time. Even when you think back to what we were doing in 2010, 2011, one of the first things we did was actually adjust ourselves into selling merchandise to our audience. We sold creative services. We just did anything and everything possible to diversify our revenue and actually be able to pay for us making these videos. What's amazing is today, this term creator economy allows for this serious diversification. Like the numbers that we told you in the beginning of this episode around how much money YouTube paid us even last month. That doesn't even make up 10% of our broader business, which means that we do have all these different elements that make up our general business or creator economy pie. And we're going to get more into that in this episode. But you know, this concept of diversification, it's not only for your business, but it's also for your personal life, which is why this episode is sponsored by public.com. The smoothest segways in the game. They call me Segway Samir. Well, public.com is an investing social network.

Yeah, you're welcome. That is nice. And there's also a real discourse on the app about these companies and and trends, which is really fun to read through. It's not just a space for memes and people just saying stonks, which where did that term stonks come from? I don't know who threw the end in there. It wasn't me. It all look at me.

I think we should congratulate all of you on starting to invest today with public.com. That's so cool. Now back to the show. So I think a lot of the reason that we've made more money in a month on our YouTube channel from YouTube than we have any other month in our past comes down to two things. One, the rise of the creator economy, which we'll get into and then to our ability to build trust. These are the two things that we think play into us making more money on YouTube from YouTube. Let's start with the rise of the creator economy. Yeah, I had a conversation with Air Act about a week ago and he was like, dude, you know what's so crazy that you have a show that covers the creator industry. And you can make a living doing that. Yeah, there are so many different ways that we can generate revenue and run a business by talking about the creator economy. I think that has to show you how much this term and this even this world has grown in the past year. So I think it's important for us to really define what the creator economy is because that term gets thrown around so much. What really is it? Who's a part of it? How does the ecosystem move money around? And that's what we're going to go into right now by speaking with Lee Jin. Who is an investor and a creator that recently raised $13 million to invest just in creator economy companies. She also wrote an article about the passion economy in the Harvard Business Review, which I think was widely seen as this like mass education across the industry, especially the venture capitalists and investors around what is this world of people monetizing their passions online and for industries to grow. It's really important that the vernacular catches up that there are terms that people can use to talk about it. And what Lee Jin helps us do is really distinguish the passion economy from the creator economy from the gig economy. So that's what we're going to get into right now. Yeah, when I started writing about the space, I used the term passion economy, which I actually think is different than the creator economy. And I think the passion economy is a superset. Like it's the overarching thing. It's the economy in which people are monetizing their passions and their individuality. In my mind, I was thinking of things like Shopify or Etsy or outskill, which is this online teaching platform where you can teach a class to K through 12 kids business like that where these people would not call themselves creators typically. But they were still monetizing their individuality and they were leveraging their imagination and their education and their creativity to make an income not tied to a particular industry vertical like content or entertainment or anything like that. It spans across many, many different industries, but the commonality of all passion economy platforms is that they're enabling people to monetize individuality and establish direct customer relationships. The creator economy, I think, is a subset of that, which owns in on people who are creating content online, creating video content or audio content or YouTube content or podcasts. Like there's a content piece at the center of the creator economy. And I think that's why it's called creators because you're creating content. In terms of how I define the creator economy, it's the economy in which people are building influence and an audience online, primarily through social platforms. And they're creating content online and building an audience and they're able to monetize that in a number of different ways. What are the differences between the gig economy and perhaps the passion economy? I think that gig economy is the opposite of the passion economy. So the gig economy is the economy in which people are really just doing commoditized tasks for money. So it doesn't really matter who they are, who the worker is. There's no customer loyalty. A lot of times there's no customer awareness even of who is doing the work for you. Like people probably couldn't answer who was the name of their last Uber driver or their last door dash driver, but you could definitely name like the last podcast that you listen to. So it's really it's the delineation is between commoditized work in the good world where you don't really care about who the person is, who's providing the service or product versus completely non commoditized. Very individual offerings in the passion economy. Is there a creator gig economy that that can emerge, whether it's like editors, thumbnail designers, like is there that world that you think could emerge? I think so. I think so. And I think looking at the social platforms, a lot of them do try to some degree to commoditize the creators themselves. Like even the concept of a feed is commoditizing a piece of content in a creator, right? Because if you don't create content one day, they'll slot in something else. And like maybe that thing is just as funny or entertaining as the creator that you'd liked. So I think social media platforms have an interest to commoditize the content in some way. And then I think in the broader ecosystem, content creators are supported by a lot of gig workers. And I think we all are. So there was a time where you and I started comparing YouTube creators to Uber drivers just in here, like in conversation, talking about how as a YouTube creator, your job is to get an audience member from point A to point B. And what that is is capturing their attention and allowing YouTube to serve relevant ads to that person. That's delivering for YouTube. And it's not that different than an Uber driver who has to take a passenger from a physical location of point A to another location at point B on behalf of Uber. But what we started to realize, and especially after talking to Lee Jen is that there's actually a really strong difference between the gig economy and the creator economy. And there are some differences and then there are also some similarities. So the main difference between a YouTube creator and an Uber driver is that Uber drivers are essentially commoditized very easily. You don't necessarily care which Uber driver picks you up, which person drops off your food with postmates. But with YouTube, you do care. They are much less commoditized. So you get my financial advice just from Graham Stefan or I only want to watch yes theory make travel videos. But when it comes to how the platforms look at creators, they actually are trying to commoditize creators because if yes theory stops uploading or Graham Stefan or us, they want to make sure that their audiences are still served so they can pop in someone else. And as creators, we kind of have to prepare for that and find a way to play into that so that it works for us as an advantage. And that's part of this second reason why I think we've been able to make more money from YouTube the platform over the past month than any month prior is because we've thought about that we've taken that into account. And we started to think how can we build trust with YouTube the platform. I think typically a lot of people think about building trust just with their audience, but not really thinking about how to build trust with YouTube, right or with whatever platform they're on because the platform also wants to know how you operate like now think about the gig economy for looking at this now as a commodity content as a commodity and an Uber driver as a commodity. YouTube wants to know that you're going to show up at the time that you said you were going to show up and wants to know that you're giving the customers a five star experience once they realize that they'll probably start serving you more same way that an Uber driver who has higher ratings and is a very trusted person for the company. They will likely get more access to rides and more opportunity to monetize. It's the same thing with the way YouTube operates where once we started shifting and saying okay every Monday at 6 am we're going to upload we're going to deliver the same type of content in a similar length to the same audience. Everything changed because now the platform can kind of see and understand we keep slotting you in we can trust that you'll be there but if we miss uploads or we all the sudden change our subject matter they can't trust that the audience that they have been serving us to is going to continue to like. What we're doing and similar to what we talked about with Graham when we had him on the podcast where he was saying that one bad upload or one missed day he doesn't even want to think about because it would mess up his whole consistency and his whole years and years of building trust with the platform and with his audience and he is an example of a phenomenal partner to YouTube someone who's built a lot of trust with them and with his audience by the time you look at his three or four channels he's uploading every single day basically to YouTube and talking about. Something related to financial literacy I see you to is like their business and I want to be a part of that business and I how can I help that business grow and how can I make that business look good and how can it be a good example for that business and so I very much understand that like YouTube is like I was so much to YouTube and I want to do anything possible to help them grow as well so I feel like if I can make good content for YouTube and feed into what they want to do. What they want and what they want to show and the message that they're trying to get out there that's going to help me in return and that's going to help get my message out there too. So once you've built trust with the platform your content is going to get served a lot more you're probably going to have more opportunities to monetize the platform and you're going to just be in a better position to grow an audience and trust with the platform is exactly tied to trust with the audience. The reason really good Uber drivers have a five star rating is because the audience deems that that's the rating because they do show up on time they have the snacks that you want or maybe you don't want maybe don't want to grab the I don't want snacks in the new. So maybe you don't want the next but the audience likes the Uber driver they give them the five star rating because they're on time the car is clean and then Uber is able to serve that driver to more audiences and YouTube is a very similar thing now where the creator economy differs from the gig economy is that once the create. Does build that trust with an audience they've actually no longer become a commodity because the audiences relationship with the creator cannot be commoditized and that's why all of these opportunities in the creator economy have sparked up that's why Lee Jen is raising 13 million dollars to create tools that support the creator economy because once you do build that trust and you do gain that audience there's so much you can do you can do what we did and sell your audience of course you can educate them right. You can become a merchant that sells clothing you can start a brand you can do a membership club where people actually want more content from your exclusive content from you and there's an industry now that actually supports that opportunity that we have a relationship with our audience now there's all these platforms like we want to create a shop cool launch it on Shopify you want to make a course think of thick teachable right there's so many options to do it so I think today like where this industry is going to be a lot of people are going to be able to do that. I think today like where this industry is today is kind of this return it's something that Lee Jen talks about but it's a return to this pre industrial era right where everyone has their own business like you think about before there was all these big corporations what did the world look like what what the economy look like you go to someone get your haircut you got another person like like a blacksmith yeah I don't really know what a blacksmith does I was wanted to go to a blacksmith what do they make metal stuff like swords and stuff okay yeah yeah it's not really relevant today but it would be really cool you go to one person to get your chickens you go to another person yet your fruit and they're not like big conglomerates it's like what Nas daily said around education he said the future of education is single person universities where you come and learn from us or you learn about content creation from Nas or you learn about personal finance from Graham Stefan like this is now reverting us back to the opportunity where everyone can be their own business and creators with their relationship with audiences can be their own businesses and that's outside of the revenue that the platform is giving them when you look at like the holistic view of a creator we've done videos about this before but you have a platform revenue which is becoming I think a smaller and smaller piece of a lot of creators business pie then you have direct to consumer revenue which might be you know merchandise or it might be exclusive content or it might be education something like that right and then you obviously have sponsorships and and brand deals and we're all the sudden starting to get into this world where this pie can get so diverse because of all the different ways that are popping up Mark Zuckerberg was quoted the other day saying that we're at an inflection point that if you're talented you can now make a good living as a creator and I tend to agree with that I think we are at kind of an inflection point in the creator economy there are now enough tools if you are a talented media creator to finance a relatively healthy living it might not be on YouTube right like even with us such a small percentage of our overall income comes from AdSense but now there are so many other ways to monetize actually whether you're a video creator even or not like you look at Casey Newton who runs platformer and has a discord channel like a private paid discord channel that's actually where Mark Zuckerberg was speaking he used to be at the which is a more traditional network but he left and now he has his own audience that pays for his right you also look at clubhouse recently adding monetization like you don't have to be on YouTube you could be really good at talking or hosting a live show and a hundred percent percent of the creator of the monetization goes to a creator that's pretty amazing you could also be on a TV show and then all the sudden have a thriving cameo business of people who want you to sing them happy birthday or you know I don't know give some funny message if you're a comedian I have this sense that cameo really took off because of tiger king like I think cameo's valuation is directly tied to tiger king sure yeah because so many people used Carol baskin in things without tiger king cameo you'd be nothing that's where I was getting at yes so just I also think what's amazing is when you look at patreon tim dillian I think is a great example of a comedian who's just killing it doing over a hundred thousand dollars on patreon that's wild and the last one I'll bring up is all gas no breaks who you know lost their deal to a bigger entertainment company came back to start a new show and the audience because they are not commoditized to their audience they are a one of one they are non fungible the audience cared about them so much that they were able to bring that content back to life on patreon right like that's amazing 1500 people decided to put their credit card down and bring that show back to life under a different name so the world today of of being a creator I think is completely different than ten years ago and I think it shows us that in ten years from now how sophisticated all this is going to be is truly unbelievable and I think you know if you're walking away with one thing in this episode it's that it's not too late to become a creator I think that's a really important thing to note it might feel overwhelming to think about like man how am I going to grow an audience but we're starting to realize now is that that world where it was just singular it was just hey I make videos and I try and get this platform to pay me for those videos that world is over now yeah these platforms are helping people monetized by selling directly to their audiences and the platforms then take a cut but on the other side of it you have platforms like YouTube that for years and years and years have been helping creators monetize their content through advertising and that's something that we talked to Josh Cohen about founder of tube filter in the stream awards just about this evolution of monetizing video content from the early days of the creator economy's inception yeah did not talk about this in terms of creator economy talked about it early then in terms of like web TV or online video and it was this idea where there's this Hollywood ecosystem and there's only so many hours a day of programming that can fit into the Hollywood ecosystem there's only so many hours of prime time every single week there's only so many shows that can be broadcast across all the networks but there exists these people that should obviously be in this ecosystem but because of a number of different factors maybe their religion race sexual orientation color their skin not giving a lucky break nepotism whatever else are just kind of hard knocks they weren't able to kind of make it or break through but with the democratization of the tools of production for entertainment now they were so they had editing tools that they're disposed they had cameras that they're disposed and with the advent of streaming platforms like YouTube they distribution that they're disposed to so there's this idea early on where there's going to there's this Hollywood ecosystem and these people that should be in the Hollywood ecosystem but aren't for whatever reason so there's going to be this new burgeoning creator class that's going to make all these TV shows that they wish they could have before that they can now and they can find an audience for it too and there were some early stars of that I think like Felicia Day is kind of the poster child of that movement and also really the only one that kind of made it big at the time of the guild where it was about a bunch of people playing dungeons and dragons and that might seem kind of like almost mainstream culture now but back at the time that was a concept that never would have been on any kind of television show a bunch of nerdy gamers playing a game talking to each other playing a game that's not even real where they're not the aren't real characters now yeah now Pokemon cards are going for millions of dollars right exactly so she created this show it got a big audience and big fan base was able to sell it to MSN I mean choose a big poster child for this industry at the first ever streaming award she talked about how she was on the periphery of Hollywood for her whole life and she felt like this kind of square peg trying to fit into the round hole of Hollywood and then the internet gave her a real big opportunity to kind of realize her creative visions and really thrive and she was super thankful for it so early on we were kind of focused on that kind of creator and then when YouTube started to get serious about embracing their creators we started to see more people get serious about YouTube and so then we started to cover more of that I mean like Phil the Franco as a famous origin story where he was like a week away from just giving up YouTube and saying yo I got to focus on school until YouTube called them up and said hey we want you to be part of this creator program got his first check for a couple hundred bucks I was like oh this good this is cool this could be something and so I feel like at that time people started to take it more seriously especially when checks are the show up regardless of the increment fifty dollars seventy five dollars couple hundred bucks really flip the switch and people's minds and said like oh this might be something and so then we started covering more of this YouTube ecosystem and then that branch into kind of like all these other creator ecosystems that developed after it so like Phil to Franco which Josh talks about we in our early stages made very small amounts of money from YouTube the platform through add sense like you mentioned earlier but the first check was thirty five cents or something roughly like that but just the idea that you could get paid for your content was novel and was interesting it was completely new even the fact that we could have a place to distribute like when I first thought about making content and distributing it I thought I was going to have to pitch a television network and I was like that's going to take years to figure out how to get some of my ideas out to people right to broadcast them and being able to do it through YouTube was was such an amazing thing like that to be to be a filmmaker right when that was happening was like oh my god this is amazing you can upload here now to figure out how to monetize was you know that you can get a lot longer path but today when you look at how people are monetizing I mean Elliott Joy who's an awesome creator recently made a video and also was covered by inside or talking about how he made $90,000 from a single video of course that video got 23 million views which is pretty amazing but the fact that you can generate $90,000 by uploading a video to this platform is crazy Shelby Church made a video talking about how last year she made over $160,000 and Graham Stefan who we've had on the show made $2 million just from the platform last year so on that note because the title of this video is about how much money YouTube the platform has paid us even though we do have so many other options to monetize let's look at how much we have made from 14 million views on our YouTube channel. Did anyone guess right? Did you remember to guess because if you didn't take the time now. Alright before we show this just last minute guesses don't skip ahead just put your guesses in the comments if anyone guessed this exactly right you're going to get a high five next time I see you. Alright the number for 14 million views YouTube has paid us $33,996.72 gives you a good frame of reference if you're someone who can generate millions and millions of views with your content there's actually still a lot of opportunity on YouTube that's pretty amazing that that the platform can pay you that much money and at this point we are starting to get more money from YouTube the platform because we are a trusted partner to them finally because we found a format where we can upload every Monday no matter what we're talking about similar topics so for us that amount of money will continue to increase hopefully month to month.
